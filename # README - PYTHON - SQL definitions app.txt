Here's a Python app using the tkinter library for the GUI and sqlparse library for parsing SQL code to provide definitions or explanations of SQL keywords.

The application will include a search bar where you can input SQL code, and the app will output the definitions of the SQL keywords present in the code.

Prerequisites:
Install the required libraries using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install tk sqlparse
Python Code:
python
Copy code
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox
import sqlparse

# Simple dictionary for SQL keyword definitions
sql_definitions = {
    "SELECT": "The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.",
    "FROM": "The FROM clause is used to specify the table to query data from.",
    "WHERE": "The WHERE clause is used to filter records that meet a certain condition.",
    "JOIN": "JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column.",
    "INSERT": "The INSERT INTO statement is used to add new records to a table.",
    "UPDATE": "The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table.",
    "DELETE": "The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records from a table.",
    "CREATE": "The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database.",
    "DROP": "The DROP TABLE statement is used to delete a table from a database.",
    "ALTER": "The ALTER TABLE statement is used to modify the structure of an existing table.",
    "GROUP BY": "The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values in specified columns.",
    "ORDER BY": "The ORDER BY statement is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.",
    "LIMIT": "The LIMIT clause is used to specify the number of records to return.",
    "HAVING": "The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions.",
    # Add more definitions as needed
}

def get_sql_definitions(sql_code):
    # Parse the SQL code
    parsed = sqlparse.parse(sql_code)[0]
    tokens = [token.value.upper() for token in parsed.tokens if not token.is_whitespace]

    # Find and return definitions
    definitions = []
    for token in tokens:
        if token in sql_definitions:
            definitions.append(f"{token}: {sql_definitions[token]}")

    return definitions if definitions else ["No SQL keywords found or defined."]

def show_definitions():
    sql_code = entry.get("1.0", tk.END).strip()
    if not sql_code:
        messagebox.showinfo("Info", "Please enter SQL code to search for definitions.")
        return
    
    definitions = get_sql_definitions(sql_code)
    result_text.set("\n\n".join(definitions))

# Initialize the main window
app = tk.Tk()
app.title("SQL Code Definition Finder")
app.geometry("500x400")

# Add a label
label = tk.Label(app, text="Enter SQL Code:")
label.pack(pady=10)

# Add a text entry box
entry = tk.Text(app, height=5, width=50)
entry.pack(pady=10)

# Add a button to get definitions
button = tk.Button(app, text="Get Definitions", command=show_definitions)
button.pack(pady=10)

# Add a label to show the results
result_text = tk.StringVar()
result_label = tk.Label(app, textvariable=result_text, justify="left", wraplength=450)
result_label.pack(pady=10)

# Run the application
app.mainloop()
How It Works:
Search Bar: You can input any SQL code in the text box.
Button: Press the "Get Definitions" button, and the app will parse the SQL code.
Definitions: The app extracts SQL keywords and searches for their definitions from the predefined dictionary. If found, it will display the definitions below.
Expanding the App:
You can expand the sql_definitions dictionary with more SQL keywords and their explanations.
The app can be enhanced further by including more advanced parsing and interpretation of SQL queries.
Enjoy coding! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
